# Pandas & Matplotlib Lab

In this lab, you will be introduced to the data manipulation and visualization tools.

- Part 1: Pandas
- Part 2: Matplotlib


*Due to the many headings, this lab works best if you have the Jupyter notebooks Collapsible headings [extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).*
