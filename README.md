# Pandas_Lab

# This is a 3 Part Lab.

- Part 1: Pandas
- Part 2: Matplotlib
- Part 3: Pokemon Deck (Optional)

### The Goal of this lab is to introduce students to the data manipulation and visualization tools that they will need to do their data science project. Due to the many headings, this lab works best if you have the Jupyter notebooks Collapsible headings [extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).
